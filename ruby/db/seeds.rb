# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database
# with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the
# db with db:setup).
#
# Seeding can occur multiple times during the execution of a single Rake task
# because seeding should occur in all environments (development, testing,
# etc.). The currently connected database can be accessed via
# `Sequel::DATABASES.last`.
